#Story behind:
The problem is named after Flavius Josephus, a Jewish historian living in the 1st century.
According to Josephus' account of the siege of Yodfat,
he and his 40 soldiers were trapped in a cave by Roman soldiers. They chose suicide over capture,
and settled on a serial method of committing suicide by drawing lots.
